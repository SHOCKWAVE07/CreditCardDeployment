## Problem Statement Description

The problem at hand is to build a credit card approval model that can effectively assess credit card applications and predict whether they will be approved or not. This model will analyze a range of input features, such as income, employment status, credit history, and more, to make accurate predictions. By automating the credit card approval process, this model can streamline operations, reduce manual effort, and enhance decision-making for credit card issuers.

## Data

The dataset used for this project contains credit card application information, including various input features and corresponding approval labels (approved or not approved). The dataset may include features such as income, employment status, credit history, age, and other relevant information.
