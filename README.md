## Problem Statement Description

The problem at hand is to build a credit card approval model that can effectively assess credit card applications and predict whether they will be approved or not. This model will analyze a range of input features, such as income, employment status, credit history, and more, to make accurate predictions. By automating the credit card approval process, this model can streamline operations, reduce manual effort, and enhance decision-making for credit card issuers.

## Data
